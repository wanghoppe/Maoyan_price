# Maoyan_price

Scrape movie price from [m.maoyan.com](http://m.maoyan.com). See _Main.ipynb_.


<p> Since the website use **Ajax** to dynamically load the webpage, used [selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org) and [phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org) to run the javascript inside the html.

<p> [Maoyan](http://m.maoyan.com) also hide the price information using self-defined font (woff file embedded in the html) to mapping characters, such as _Ôê∞_ to number number _5_. I used the **convert** method from  [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org) to generate a _30dp x 20dp_ .jpg image file and recognized the number within using a 3 layer neural networks. The training data source and the training of the neural networks can refer to the _ipython notebook_ in the _training_ directory.
